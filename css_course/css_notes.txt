initial style < browser sheets < custom styling

inheritance occurs for most elements (like if i have a div around a p the p will have the same style )
    - one that doesn't is border
    - can say inherit 

all -> sets everything toether unset inherit and initial
rever -> default to browser 


specificity - css runs top to bottom (overrides as you read)
    - class selectors are more specific so it will finish there
    - 0000 - ids change second column, classes change third column, elements change fourth column, first column is inline style
        - first column is left most
    - !important OVERRIDES
