the why React 
    - makes UI easier through being a JS library
    - components point to some html
    - declarative, component-based (encapsulation of more and more stuff)
JSX props
    - props: arguments to a function EXTERNAL
        - what it takes in - good for less changes like displaying a name
    - state: what is already INSIDE a component
        - rerenders when made - good for updates like counters
State
