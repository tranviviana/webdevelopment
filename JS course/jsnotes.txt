JS loading
    - js file pauses to download and then goes through the rest 
        - ASYNC tag asynchronously downloads and pauses HTML parsing during execution
        - DEFER tag asynchronously downloads... executes after html is done parsing
    - <script defer or asyng src = "large.js></script>

Var, Let, and Const
    - var: function scope accessible throughout the function, can be redefined within the function
        - var variable can be declined after usage; usage will say undefined tho
    - let and const: block scoped (if or loop) CAN NOT overwrite
        - const can change properties inside 
        - let lets you change value (iterator)

Creating and Using Functions
    - if arguments not passed through, set to undefined
    - return for needed outputted
    CALLBACKS
    - a function is just an object in js
