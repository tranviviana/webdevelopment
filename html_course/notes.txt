1)<!DOCTYPE html>
2)<html>3)<head>4)<body></body></head></html>

1) is NECESSARRY for all html files
2) determines that all the stuff inside is html 
3) doesn't actually show but is considered the title <title> changes the tab name <meta name= "description" content= "thisis" it'll show underneath title on google search
4) does actually show

<element></element> considered start tag and end tag and has info inside
<empty> empty tag like an image tag

In body 
<header><nav></nav></header>
- these tags define the elements but its not a direct change
<hr> horizontal rule
<footer> hangs on ths bottom of page

HTML entities are special symbols that mess up certain written code "<"
-to remedy use &# with a special code


Meaningless elements
    - div: content is in a different line
    - span: content is in the same line
<br> breaks distant
<!-- --> comment

<strong> bolds it


anchor tag <a> allows us to link stuff
    -<a href="file.html"> Link Text </a>
    -target = "_self" it opens on itself
    -target - "_blank" it will open as another tab like a popup



Forms
! enter = boiler point stuff
<form action= -- where form is submitting to method="GET" --append to url and send to other site > 
--POST ---send to backend
<label for="id" --highlights (makes clicky thing) what it is for when clicked> -- name to put before
<input name="fhdjks" --- essentially like a label for the inputs value="User"--default value placeholder="user" default greyed out (can be replaced) required---have to put something in > 
input-- location to put stuff
when input is type ="number" can set min to be a number and max to be another numebr

<lael for="male">Male</label><input type="radio" name ="gender" id="male> ---allows for only one checkbox to be checked NEED general name value --to gather data
select --options == dropdown
 <select name="eyes" id="eyes">
                <option value="Green">Green</option>
                <option label="Red" value="Red">Red</option>
            </select>
            the label section make sure under same drop

  <select name="eyes" id="eyes" multiple> multiple -- for multiple selects

</form>
